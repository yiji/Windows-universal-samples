# Wi-Fi Direct sample

This sample shows how to use the Wi-Fi Direct API to discover devices and connect to the them over Wi-Fi Direct.

Specifically, this sample shows how to:

- **Advertise a Wi-Fi Direct device:** A device can advertise it's presence so that other Wi-Fi Direct devices can discover and connect to it. There are optional settings that an advertiser may specify, such as custom information elements to share during discovery, and options for how to establish a connection.
- **Discover a Wi-Fi Direct device:** Discover advertising devices over Wi-Fi Direct.
- **Connect to a device/Accept an incoming connection:** After discovering a Wi-Fi Direct device, a device may connect to it. The advertising device may accept or decline the connection.
- **Send data over Wi-Fi Direct after connecting to a device:** Connected peers may open TCP and UDP sockets and send data. This sample just sends text strings as a sample.

**Note** This sample requires two or more devices with Wi-Fi chipsets and drivers that support Wi-Fi Direct.
 
**Note**ï¿½This sample was created using one of the universal app templates available in Visual Studio. It shows how its solution is structured so it can run on Windows 10. For more info about how to build apps that target Windows and Windows Phone with Visual Studio, see [Build apps that target Windows 10 by using Visual Studio](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn609832).

## System requirements

**Client:** Windows 10

**Server:** Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview

**Phone:**  Windows 10

## Build the sample

1. If you download the samples ZIP, be sure to unzip the entire archive, not just the folder with the sample you want to build. 
2. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
3. Starting in the folder where you unzipped the samples, go to the Samples subfolder, then the subfolder for this specific sample, then the subfolder for your preferred language (C++, C#, or JavaScript). Double-click the Visual Studio 2015 Solution (.sln) file.
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.

## Run the sample

The next steps depend on whether you just want to deploy the sample or you want to both deploy and run it.

### Deploying the sample

- Select **Build** \> **Deploy Solution**. 

### Deploying and running the sample

- To debug the sample and then run it, press F5 or select **Debug** \> **Start Debugging**. To run the sample without debugging, press Ctrl+F5 or select **Debug** \> **Start Without Debugging**. 

**Note** You will need to deploy the sample to at least two devices in order to actually discover and connect to devices, unless you are using the sample to interact with other devices that support Wi-Fi Direct.

This sample demonstrates:

-   Viewing cached list of available networks on each WiFi adapter on the system
-   Requesting a scan on a WiFi adapter and and viewing the results
-   Registering for available network changed notifications on a WiFi adapter
-   Connecting to a WiFi network

## System requirements

**Client:** Windows 10

**Server:** Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview

**Phone:**  Windows 10

## Build the sample

1. If you download the samples ZIP, be sure to unzip the entire archive, not just the folder with the sample you want to build. 
2. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
3. Starting in the folder where you unzipped the samples, go to the Samples subfolder, then the subfolder for this specific sample, then the subfolder for your preferred language (C++, C#, or JavaScript). Double-click the Visual StudioÂ 2015 Solution (.sln) file.
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.

## Run the sample

The next steps depend on whether you just want to deploy the sample or you want to both deploy and run it.

### Deploying the sample

- Select **Build** \> **Deploy Solution**. 

### Deploying and running the sample

- To debug the sample and then run it, press F5 or select **Debug** \> **Start Debugging**. To run the sample without debugging, press Ctrl+F5 or select **Debug** \> **Start Without Debugging**. 

Each scenario has buttons you can use to perform the actions described in the scenario text. If you do not have any WiFi Adapters on your system, you will not be able to experience the scenarios.

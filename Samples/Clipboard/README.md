# Clipboard sample

This sample demonstrates how an app can use clipboard commands, including copy, paste, cut, and move. This sample uses classes from the [**Windows.ApplicationModel.DataTransfer**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br205967) namespace. Some of the classes you might want to review in more detail include the [**Clipboard**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br205867) class, which accesses the Clipboard, and the [**DataPackage**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br205873) class, which you use to package the content before adding it to the Clipboard.

This sample covers the following:

-   How to copy and paste text
-   How to copy and paste an image
-   How to copy and paste files
-   How to get the formats on the Clipboard
-   How to detect changes to the Clipboard

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2015 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
 
To obtain information about Windows 10 development, go to the [Windows Dev Center](https://dev.windows.com)

To obtain information about Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and the tools for developing Windows apps, go to [Visual Studio 2015](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532422)

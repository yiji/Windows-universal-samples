The sample demonstrates these tasks:

1.  **Analyze Japanese text**

    This scenario shows how to use the [**GetWords**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn434078) method to split Japanese text, one segment per line.
    The segments can be words or pronunciation units.

**Note** The Universal Windows app samples require Visual Studio 2015 to build and Windows 10 to execute.

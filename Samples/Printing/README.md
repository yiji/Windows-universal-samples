# Printing sample

This sample demonstrates how apps can add support for printing on Windows. 

The scenarios demonstrated in this sample include:

- Adding support for printing using app UX
- Customizing the print experience by changing how the printer settings are shown to the user
- Using a custom print template to print a range of pages
- Printing alternate content that is not part of the current document

Changes from previous versions of the sample:
- Removed charms-based printing scenario
- Refactored BasePrintPage out of solution for increased clarity. Sample now uses PageToPrint class and PrintHelper class instead. 
- Added exception handling to ShowPrintUIAsync calls
- Updated app to Universal Windows Platform (UWP)

# Smart cards sample

This sample demonstrates how to use the Windows.Devices.SmartCards API to work with smart cards and smart card readers programmatically.

**Note**  This sample was created using one of the universal app templates available in Visual Studio. It shows how its solution is structured so it can run on both Windows 10 and Windows Phone 10.

Specifically, this sample shows the scenarios of:
- Creating a virtual smart card
- Changing the PIN on a virtual smart card
- Resetting the PIN on a virtual smart card
- Changing the admin key
- Verifying the response
- Deleting a virtual smart card
- Listing all the smart cards on the machine
- Transmitting

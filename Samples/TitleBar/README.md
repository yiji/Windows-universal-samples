# Title bar sample

This sample shows various ways of customizing the title bar.

The sample shows the following techniques:

- Customizing the colors in the standard system title bar.
- Extending the view into the title bar, so you can draw a custom title bar.
- Responding to changes in title bar states.
- Drawing controls in the title bar (XAML only).

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2015 to build and Windows 10 to execute.

**Note** Not all of the title bar functionality is available in all builds. Functionality will arrive gradually as newer builds are released.

To obtain information about Windows 10 development, go to the [Windows Dev Center](https://dev.windows.com)

To obtain information about Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and the tools for developing Windows apps, go to [Visual Studio 2015](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532422)

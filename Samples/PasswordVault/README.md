# Credential locker sample

The Credential Locker, also known as Password Vault,
provides a way for you to store user credentials (username, password) in a secure fashion for your app.
Usernames and passwords stored using the Credential Locker are encrypted and saved locally.
Once you have the credentials stored, you can automatically sign users in for a more convenient user experience.
Additionally, user credentials stored in the Credential Locker roam with the user's Microsoft Account for added convenience.
The Credential Locker can be used whether your app supports a single user accessing a single resource,
a single user accessing multiple resources,
multiple users accessing a single resource,
or
multiple users accessing multiple resources.
For more information, see the reference materials below.

This sample demonstrates the following operations:

- Saving credentials
- Reading a specific credential
- Reading all saved credentials
- Reading all saved credentials for a specific resource
- Reading all saved credentials for a specific user
- Requesting passwords from saved credentials
- Removing saved credentials

On the PC, users can manage their credentials from the desktop control panel under
User Accounts, Credential Manager.

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2015 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
 
To obtain information about Windows 10 development, go to the [Windows Dev Center](https://dev.windows.com)

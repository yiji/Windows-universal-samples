# Caller ID sample

This sample shows how to set Call Origin information for an unrecognized incoming call.

Specifically, this sample shows how to:
- Register a Caller ID background task to be triggered when an unrecognized incoming call arrives.
  The task sets the call location, category, category description, and display name of the call.
- Display the system UI to let the user choose the active Caller ID app.
- Determine whether the app is the the active Caller ID app.

See the Package.appxmanifest file for the extensions and capabilities a Caller ID app must declare.

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2015 to build and Windows 10 to execute.

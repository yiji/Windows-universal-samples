# Disabling screen capture sample

This sample shows how to disable screen capture by setting the
[**IsScreenCaptureEnabled**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn281123)
property of the
[**ApplicationView**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh701658)
object.

The sample consists of the following scenarios:

- Allow screen capture by taking no special action. Screen capture is allowed by default.
- Blocking screen capture for a specific page
  by setting [**IsScreenCaptureEnabled**](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn281123)
  to **false** when the user navigates to the page, then setting it back to **true** when the user navigates away.

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2015 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
 
To obtain information about Windows 10 development, go to the [Windows Dev Center](https://dev.windows.com)

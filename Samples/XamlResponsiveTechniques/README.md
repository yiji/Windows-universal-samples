# Responsiveness techniques sample

Showcases a UI scenario from Settings (Personalization UI) and highlights the simple responsive techniques we have introduced in Windows 10 – namely, VisualState.Setters, AdaptiveTriggers, SplitView and RelativePanel (static and dynamically modifying properties). This sample can be viewed as a getting started sample.

**Note** The Windows universal samples require Visual Studio 2015 to build and Windows 10 to execute.
 
To obtain information about Windows 10 development, go to the [Windows Dev Center](https://dev.windows.com)

1. If you download the samples ZIP, be sure to unzip the entire archive, not just the folder with the sample you want to build. 
2. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
3. Starting in the folder where you unzipped the samples, go to the Samples subfolder, then the subfolder for this specific sample, then the subfolder for your preferred language (C++, C#, or JavaScript). Double-click the Visual Studio 2015 Solution (.sln) file.
4. Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.
